We are inviting you to register for submitting your proposal here. The most interesting papers, which will be presented for the public at the beginning of April, are going to be chosen by voting, so make sure you&#8217;ve made your proposal in advance.</p><h3 id='guidelines'>Guidelines</h3><ul><li>Submit your proposal by March 31st, 2014, 23:59:59 CEST. No excuses!</li><li>All talks are in English.</li><li>Talks are usually 30 minutes long (for longer talks we&#8217;d get in touch with you directly). We will be on a tight schedule and also enforce the end of a talk casually, friendly and clearly. We strongly encourage timing your presentation in advance.</li><li>Typos, sloppy formatting and poor-grammar submissions make reading of your proposal tedious. So make sure, you&#8217;ve carefully reviewed your work to increase your chances to win.</li><li>Remember, less is more. The quicker you can show the main point, the better.</li><li>Keep your content original. We can&#8217;t afford speaking about the same things annually, so try to be a pioneer.</li></ul><h3 id='the_perks'>The Perks</h3><p>If you get selected as a speaker at EuRuKo, here&#8217;s what you get:</p><ul><li>A round trip to Kyiv covered. It means that usually we pay for your plane or train ticket.</li><li>Accommodation booked and covered for the period of the conference. All information on your hotel and stuff you&#8217;ll receive via the e-mail.</li><li>Entrance to the conference covered. We won&#8217;t be done with the speaker selections by the end of the ticket sales, so if you want to make sure you really CAN attend, you may want to purchase a ticket regardless. If you get selected to speak and if you need to, we can refund your ticket.</li></ul><h3 id='the_selection_process'>The Selection Process</h3><p>Not us, but your readers are those who pick up the smartest papers. We don&#8217;t bias against anything related to the submitting person.</p><p>Two rounds of voting:</p><ul><li>The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 10.</li><li>The top-N (~40) submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: &#8216;OK&#8217;, &#8216;WOW&#8217;, &#8216;MUST HAVE&#8217;.</li></ul><p>We expect about 100 excellent submissions for 14 speaking slots. The process helps us to select the right ones. Roughly, that&#8217;s all about the paper process. Ping us if there are still some questions via <a href='mailto:hi@euruko.org'>hi@euruko.org</a>.</p><p>Last but not least, the committee may (or may not) invite maximum of 4 speakers on it&#8217;s own. This is done to select keynote speaker and those who we think will be a great benefit to the community.</p><iframe frameborder='0' height='1500' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' src='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ErQwvmneEEy2p4NZvFPkjl1d9vUPEBzJV_BaJfkG4bc/viewform?embedded=true' width='500'>Loading...</iframe>"
