    "post": "<p>We are very sad to announce that EuRuKo 2014 has to be cancelled. Here’s why.</p><p>We started to prepare EuRuKo 2014 in Kiev straight after getting back from EuRuKo in Athens last year. We’ve found an awesome venue, a great after-party place, organized tickets in advance. A great conference season and an awesome opportunity to introduce Ukraine to the community — what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Though, something did go wrong. What started as a peaceful meeting in Kiev last November, grew into something bigger, into something you’ve most definitely heard about.</p><p>Many other conferences in Ukraine (PyCon and iOSonRailsConf, just to name a few) were canceled this year, however we didn’t lose hope for a change to host the conference as it was planned.</p><p>After we realized that the state of the country is shaky to say the least in February, we started planning to move EuRuKo in another city. We immediately got in touch with Zurich folks, but given the timetable, there were no proper venues available. We’ve also visited Tel Aviv and Vilnius to evaluate possible alternatives, but reality was quite similar.</p><p>So, because of the current situation in Ukraine, it turns out that we can’t guarantee safety for each and every fellow attendee — things have proven themselves to be quite unpredictable.</p><p>For this reason we had to make the decision to cancel EuRuKo 2014.</p><p>We hope you understand the circumstances under which we have taken this hard decision. When things calm down, we look forward to inviting you over here in our beautiful city of Kiev.</p><p>We will organize the voting for the next year in the next few months.</p><p>Cheers,</p><p>Natalia, Julia, Vlad</p><p>P.S. If you’ve already got a ticket, don’t worry — we will issue a refund.</p>"

Party and not only</h3><h4 id='kyiv_10_facts_you_didnt_know'>Kyiv. 10 facts you didn’t know</h4><p>The capital and the largest city of Ukraine, Kyiv, has got its right to be one of the greatest educational, cultural, social, technological centers and historical landmarks.</p><p><strong>Fact #1:</strong> The city’s name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders. <br /> <strong>Fact #2:</strong> Kyiv belongs to top 10 most populated European cities with its 2 819 566 inhabitants. <br /> <strong>Fact #3:</strong> The city subway station Arsenalna is the deepest in the world and goes 105 down under the surface. Having been built in 1960 in the nearby to the parliament building, the tunnels of the station are believed to conceal secret chambers costructed for the political elite. <br /> <strong>Fact #4:</strong> 2 of 6 world heritage defined by UNESCO are here, in Kyiv: Saint Sofia Cathedral (XI century) and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (1051). A unique Saint Andrew’s church is probably going to be the next one (1749 year) in the UNESCO list. <br /> <strong>Fact #5:</strong> Close to the railway station in Kyiv you can see the 3d most visited Mcdonald’s on the planet! Impressively, but last year there were made 2 283 399 orders. This makes it the 5th most crowded Mc in the world. <br /> <strong>Fact #6:</strong> This year the city turns 1532 years old. <br /> <strong>Fact #7:</strong> There is a distinguished Museum of Miniature in Kyiv with its famous “pricked flea” showpiece. Among other exponents there are: the tiniest book in the world, a rose placed on a hair, etc. <br /> <strong>Fact #8:</strong> The central city street is one of the shortest among the similar (only 1225 meters long) and at the same time one of the most picturesque and broadest. <br /> <strong>Fact #9:</strong> At the end of XIX century, the remains of Trypillian culture, which is one of the oldest in the world, were found 50 km from the city. <br /> <strong>Fact #10:</strong> Kyiv is the second European city that launched an electric tram system.</p><p><br /></p><h4 id='visa'>Visa</h4><p>For most European countries and US citizens no visa is required for stay up to 60­90 days. To see the requirements for your country, go <a href='http://mfa.gov.ua/en/consular-affairs/entering-ukraine/visa-requirements-for-foreigners'>here</a> and check. However, if you still need visa, let us know at <a href=''>hi@euruko2014.org</a>.</p><h4 id='transportation'>Transportation</h4><ul><li>The most comfortable way to get to Kyiv by air. Obviously there’s a bus option which is not recommended.</li><li>After you’ve landed at Boryspil and successfully left the airport, take a Skybus or a taxi with official taxi top to get to the city. The Skybus ­ safe and cheap ­ will carry you straight to the train station, where you can go to your hotel by bus, subway, or taxi. The fastest way in such a busy city as Kyiv, it’s a subway (here you go, your <a href='http://www.ukraine-insight.com.ua/metro.html'>subway map</a>!). Although it’s fast, I do realise that you don’t want to study the routes of Kyiv after exhausting trip. So, take a taxi with an English speaking driver. One of the following numbers must work (find more taxis <a href='http://takso.com.ua/en/'>here</a>):</li></ul><div style='text-align:center;'> <h4>TAXI</h4> <ul> <li>+38 (044) 249­22­33</li> <li>+38 (050) 140­22­33</li> <li>+38 (063) 894­22­33</li> <li>+38 (067) 311­22­33</li> </ul> </div><p><br /></p><h4 id='food'>Food</h4><p>As for food there are tons of places to eat out.

Next goes <a href='http://tolstoy.kiev.ua'>Tolstoy</a> ­ a restaurant of French and Italian cuisine and club. Listen to glamorous concerts and hang out in the elegant company. Find it at Krasnoarmiyska str. (<a href='https://maps.google.com.ua/?hl=uk'>location</a>). The third spot in my list called <a href='http://www.club44.com.ua/club.html'>44 club</a> deserves a title of an artistic house.

A perfect shot is being taken… Not a lyrics at all but my foresight of your possible outstanding trip to one of the most extraordinary Ukrainian tourist deck, the Chornobyl city with its live preservation of 80s.
