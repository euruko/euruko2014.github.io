    "post": "<h3 id='unforgettable_exploration'>Unforgettable exploration</h3><p>In the middle of a deserted city are starring visitors full of questions, exaltation and amazement, and probably they are a bit hungry but hopefully the lunch is about to start. Though the area is quite worn off, isolated, old-fashioned, soviet-union like, lonely, it is vivid, safe and in some way unspoiled by the human. A perfect shot is being taken&#8230; Not a lyrics at all but my foresight of your possible outstanding trip to one of the most extraordinary Ukrainian tourist deck, the Chornobyl city with its live preservation of 80s. If you are an eager and adventurous traveller, venture to one of <a href='http://imgur.com/a/D9iDC'>33 most beautiful abandoned places</a>.</p><p><strong>Chornobyl &amp; Pripyat excursion timetable</strong></p><ul><li>08:00 - departure from Kyiv.</li><li>10:00 - arrival to post control Dytyatky, document check and departure to the Exclusion Zone.</li><li>10:30 - Introductory chat: general overview of the Chornobyl tragedy, Chornobyl Exclusion zone, today’s life over there.</li><li>11:00 - Introductory sightseeing trip in Chornobyl (the harbor, Illin’s Cathedral, the Park of Glory, a museum).</li><li>14:00 - Ecologically safe lunch at the diner (all groceries are thoroughly checked and brought from the pure environment).</li><li>15:00 - Chornobyl APP (Atomic Power-plant) excursion. Stop at the observation platform before the 4th power block gate with the view to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_Nuclear_Power_Plant_sarcophagus'>the Sarcophagus</a>.</li><li><li>00 - Trip to the city of Prypiat. Walk through the “Dead City” (you’ll see: the restaurant of 80s, the House of Culture Energetyk, the Polissya hotel, an entertainment park, the Lazurnyi pool, etc.).</li></li><li>17:30 - The end of the introductory and sightseeing trip.

Not only for the curious, but also for the eager history learners is this a chance to see the mistakes of the past. By the way, the food was awesome, fed to satiety,”</em> comments one of excursion visitors. Check out the Prypyat river and Chornobyl city. The territory looks ordinary and pristine, unspoiled and just perfect to live on.</p><img alt='Chornobyl 1' src='blog/attachments/chornobyl1.png' style='width:100%;' /><p>The alley of Chornobyl zone extincted villages reminds us about those places and their inhabitants who sacrificed their lives in the catastrophe. <img alt='Chornobyl 2' src='blog/attachments/chornobyl2.png' style='width:100%;' /></p>"

The quicker you can show the main point, the better.</li><li>Keep your content original.

We don&#8217;t bias against anything related to the submitting person.</p><p>Two rounds of voting:</p><ul><li>The first round rates each talk on a scale from 1 to 10.</li><li>The top-N (~40) submissions are rated again on a 3-point scale: &#8216;OK&#8217;, &#8216;WOW&#8217;, &#8216;MUST HAVE&#8217;.</li></ul><p>We expect about 100 excellent submissions for 14 speaking slots. The process helps us to select the right ones. Roughly, that&#8217;s all about the paper process. Ping us if there are still some questions via <a href='mailto:hi@euruko.org'>hi@euruko.org</a>.</p><p>Last but not least, the committee may (or may not) invite maximum of 4 speakers on it&#8217;s own.
