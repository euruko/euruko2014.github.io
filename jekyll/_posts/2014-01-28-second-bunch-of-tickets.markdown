###Announcing


We know you've been waiting too long but it's over and on the 4th of February 2014 your EuRuKo tickets will be open for sale [here](http://euruko2014.ticketforevent.com/) (we'll definitely twit about that).

###Price


The ticket price is going to be 58 EUR per piece (650 UAH). Great price for the even greater event. Annually we've got a responsible host and traditionally amazing sponsors, and with the motto 'by the community for the community' we continue bring use and joy to tech gigs.

###Ticket number


There are only 600 tickets available, so make sure you've succeeded to buy one sooner. In the February batch we'll be selling next 200 tickets (the first one was sold in November, 2013).

###Process


What do I get with a ticket?


1. You may vote for those great minds who are going to speak at the conference.
2. Though we haven't finalized the list of our famous guests, as soon as we have, you'll be the first to know.
3. Party! Party! Partyâ€¦ and not only (a travel guide and other cultural entertainments find [here](https://docs.google.com/a/passety.com/document/d/1_oUlCGHV3Sf29DTYk0mkX0DO4gNg0-Q2e4nZGAU3RcY/edit))
