We are very sad to announce that EuRuKo 2014 has to be cancelled. Here's why.


We started to prepare EuRuKo 2014 in Kiev straight after getting back from EuRuKo in Athens last year. We’ve found an awesome venue, a great after-party place, organized tickets in advance. A great conference season and an awesome opportunity to introduce Ukraine to the community — what could possibly go wrong?


Though, something did go wrong. What started as a peaceful meeting in Kiev last November, grew into something bigger, into something you’ve most definitely heard about.


Many other conferences in Ukraine (PyCon and iOSonRailsConf, just to name a few) were canceled this year, however we didn’t lose hope for a change to host the conference as it was planned. 


After we realized that the state of the country is shaky to say the least in February, we started planning to move EuRuKo in another city. We immediately got in touch with Zurich folks, but given the timetable, there were no proper venues available. We’ve also visited Tel Aviv and Vilnius to evaluate possible alternatives, but reality was quite similar.


So, because of the current situation in Ukraine, it turns out that we can’t guarantee safety for each and every fellow attendee — things have proven themselves to be quite unpredictable.


For this reason we had to make the decision to cancel EuRuKo 2014.


We hope you understand the circumstances under which we have taken this hard decision. When things calm down, we look forward to inviting you over here in our beautiful city of Kiev.


We will organize the voting for the next year in the next few months.


Cheers,


Natalia, Julia, Vlad


P.S. If you’ve already got a ticket, don’t worry — we will issue a refund.
