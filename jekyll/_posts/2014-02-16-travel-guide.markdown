####Kyiv. 10 facts you didn’t know


The capital and the largest city of Ukraine, Kyiv, has got its right to be one of the greatest educational, cultural, social, technological centers and historical landmarks.

  <br/>
  **Fact #4:** 2 of 6 world heritage defined by UNESCO are here, in Kyiv: Saint Sofia Cathedral (XI century) and Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (1051). A unique Saint Andrew’s church is probably going to be the next one (1749 year) in the UNESCO list.
  <br/>

####Visa

For most European countries and US citizens no visa is required for stay up to 60­90 days. To see the requirements for your country, go [here](http://mfa.gov.ua/en/consular-affairs/entering-ukraine/visa-requirements-for-foreigners) and check. However, if you still need visa, let us know at [hi@euruko2014.org]().


####Transportation

  * The most comfortable way to get to Kyiv by air. Obviously there’s a bus option which is not recommended.

  * After you’ve landed at Boryspil and successfully left the airport, take a Skybus or a taxi with official taxi top to get to the city. The Skybus ­ safe and cheap ­ will carry you straight to the train station, where you can go to your hotel by bus, subway, or taxi. The fastest way in such a busy city as Kyiv, it’s a subway (here you go, your [subway map](http://www.ukraine-insight.com.ua/metro.html)!). Although it’s fast, I do realise that you don’t want to study the routes of Kyiv after exhausting trip. So, take a taxi with an English speaking driver. One of the following numbers must work (find more taxis [here](http://takso.com.ua/en/)):



<div style='text-align:center;'>
  <h4>TAXI</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>+38 (044) 249­22­33</li>
    <li>+38 (050) 140­22­33</li>
    <li>+38 (063) 894­22­33</li>
    <li>+38 (067) 311­22­33</li>
  </ul>
</div>

####Sightseeing

* To start with, personally I’d advise to see such eminent historical landmarks as [Golden Gate](http://goo.gl/maps/BmU6b) (see how to get there from the conference venue [here](http://goo.gl/maps/hUhcx)), [Opera House](http://goo.gl/maps/1QihR), [Mariyinskyi Palace](http://goo.gl/maps/ziiQB), [the House with Chimeras](http://goo.gl/maps/bIPYE), and, probably, [the House with Cats](http://goo.gl/maps/HuFWC). I wouldn’t also miss the chance to see the spiritual side of the city with its heart in [Pechersk Lavra](http://goo.gl/maps/QDKOC), and [Saint Sophia's Cathedral](http://goo.gl/maps/yMqTr). What else, well, there’s [Trukhaniv Island](http://goo.gl/maps/yqNLE) to see Kyiv a bit further.

* A few art galleries for art lovers or simply for inspiration: [PinchukArtCentre](http://pinchukartcentre.org/) ­ definitely worth visiting, an international centre for contemporary art of the 21st century. Next one in my list is [Zeh (Tsekh) Gallery](http://www.zeh.com.ua/) that is focused on opening new names in the contemporary art from their start till they turn into stars. Then goes [Ya Gallery](http://www.yagallery.com.ua/aboutus/) that supports, develops and popularizes Ukrainian contemporary art. 150 different projects annually are launched both in Ukraine and abroad by the gallery.


<br/>


####Side activities

* Chornobyl excursion

* Clubs


There’re a few places I may share as worthy ones. First that goes on the list is [Crystal Hall](http://crystalhall.com.ua/), it’s a
concert, gallery, disco, event hall. Pretty fancy, quite expensive.
Next goes [Tolstoy](http://tolstoy.kiev.ua) ­ a restaurant of French and Italian cuisine and club. Listen to glamorous
concerts and hang out in the elegant company. Find it at Krasnoarmiyska str. ([location](https://maps.google.com.ua/?hl=uk)).
The third spot in my list called [44 club](http://www.club44.com.ua/club.html) deserves a title of an artistic house. Musicians, painters, writers, shortly, artistic bohemia adore the place. You won’t find the sign but that’s the concept! Old, dark porch of the building at 44 Khreshchatyk hidden for the artistic events. Come on in;).



###General notes

####Electricity

The electrical current in Ukraine is 220V AC. The plug­and­socket connection is different from one used in the United States. If you take appliances from your home, do not forget to take a converter and a plug adapter in order you could use your electrical appliance in Ukraine. For valuable equipment, it is recommended that you bring a surge protector to keep your electrical appliance safe. Note that devices not rated for 50 Hz will hardly operate properly.
