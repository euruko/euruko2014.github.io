EuRuKo 2014 is going to happen and nothing will stop it! On 20th—21st of June come to Kyiv International Center of Culture and Arts. That's a splendid venue for the fellow Rubyists who are going to visit EuRuKo 2014.


Before you start out, be sure that you'll be welcomed, expected, appreciated and certainly pleased to hit Kyiv, a great destination of the upcoming EuRuKo. Our team is preparing everything needed to repeat and expand last year's success, including sightseeing options and the afterparty place.


Speaking about the team, to make you feel safe and trustful, we are experts successfully running thе developers conferences, meetups and RailsGirls events for years on end.
